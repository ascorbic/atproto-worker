This file provides guidance to agentic coding tools when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This is a monorepo using pnpm workspaces with the following structure:

- **Root**: Workspace configuration and shared tooling
- **packages/pds**: The main PDS library (`@ascorbic/pds-worker`)
- **demos/pds**: Demo PDS deployment

## Commands

### Root-level commands (run from repository root):

- `pnpm build` - Build all packages
- `pnpm test` - Run tests for all packages
- `pnpm check` - Run type checking and linting for all packages
- `pnpm format` - Format code using Prettier

### Package-level commands (run within individual packages):

- `pnpm build` - Build the package using tsdown (ESM + DTS output)
- `pnpm dev` - Watch mode for development
- `pnpm test` - Run vitest tests
- `pnpm check` - Run publint and @arethetypeswrong/cli checks

## Development Workflow

- Uses **pnpm** as package manager
- **tsdown** for building TypeScript packages with ESM output and declaration files
- **vitest** for testing
- **publint** and **@arethetypeswrong/cli** for package validation
- **Prettier** for code formatting (configured to use tabs in `.prettierrc`)

## Package Architecture

Each package in `packages/` follows this structure:

- `src/index.ts` - Main entry point
- `test/` - Test files
- `dist/` - Built output (ESM + .d.ts files)
- Package exports configured for ESM-only with proper TypeScript declarations

## TypeScript Configuration

Uses strict TypeScript configuration with:

- Target: ES2022
- Module: preserve (for bundler compatibility)
- Strict mode with additional safety checks (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`)
- Library-focused settings (declaration files, declaration maps)
